### What I learned

I just discovered the CSS `clamp()` function, and it's a game-changer! With clamp(), I can set a value range for
properties like width or font size. By specifying a minimum, preferred, and maximum value, the browser automatically
selects the best value based on available space. It's perfect for responsive designs that adapt to different screen
sizes. Excited to explore more possibilities with `clamp()`!

### Continued development

In future projects, I will continue building my responsive web design skills while working with some
HTML and Css tools like `clamp()` and media queries

### Useful resources

- [MDN Clamp() Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This helped to understand the
  concept of clamp and i love how they simplified everything on the documentation
